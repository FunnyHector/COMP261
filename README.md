# COMP261
All assignments I've done in COMP261 trimester 1, 2016

This is the first stop of my GitHub voyage. It's been fun! Just learnt how to use GitHub.
Ye I know I'm a noob, don't laugh.

This repo is just a personal backup for what I've coded in COMP261.
Assignments are at A+ level.

Pround of it.



BUT, a big BUT:

# DO NOT COPY MY CODE, LATER STUDENTS! 
I know you will search for other's work on github, cos I did it too.
You should know that YOU'LL LEARN NOTHING DOING THAT!

YOU CAN READ AND LEARN OTHERS' CODE BUT DO NOT STEAL.
